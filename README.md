# CriticalMass
Critical Mass, rewritten in rust

## ...why?

* for fun
* as a learning experience
* as a social experiment; open source games arent new, but modern, advanced, and multiplayer source-available games are pretty novel
* because I'm in too deep not to finish this God-forsaken project

## why rust?
* minimized attak surface; clients and servers are less vulnerable to common vulnerabilities
* blazingly fast™️🦀
* we get to use wgpu and rapier :D

## what's special about Critical Mass?
* physics-driven netcode inspired by rocket league and halo: reach
* long-term hobby project
