This is an implementation of WebGPU using wgpu.

This codebase implements:

* Fast, automatic object (.obj/.mat) loading
* Plug-and-play integration with preexisting materials and textures
* Instancing (any number of objects can be rendered with one draw call)

TODO if I have time:
* Finish integration with Rapier physics
